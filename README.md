# Infinity Desktop
An attempt to roll a NetBSD desktop.

We have always been attracted to NetBSD for some unknown reason. We are not saying it's the best BSD distro, it just seems to have a magnetic pull on us. Consequently, we want to make a good desktop experience with a solid operating system under the hood.

### First
We are **not** experts, but we are willing to dig in, willing to learn and willing to listen to sound advice. We do not feel that everything needs to be "invented by us." We are more than willing to _rip-off_ good ideas.

### Second
We are **not** NetBSD zealots. We are NetBSD **enthusiasts**. We won't bash Windows or scoff at any distro of Linux. We will, however, try to learn from them, borrowing the good ideas and avoiding painful ones.

We will also not try to make os108 Windows-like, Mac-like or Linux-like; it will be NetBSD-like. Honestly, this may not be for everyone.


Roadmap and other misc things are on our [wiki](https://github.com/rgeorgia/OS108/wiki)

Totally inspired by the good folks that brought you [GhostBSD](https://github.com/ghostbsd)! GhostBSD is built on [TrueOS](https://www.trueos.org/), which is another excellent project.

We totally endorse their work and recommend you check them out. Some of us even support them financially. Yup we love GhostBSD!

The other major "kick in the pants" which I needed came from the author of [OS108](https://github.com/OS108/os108.github.io).
Jay is a great guy and I would also recommend that you visit his github repo and an excellent
forum he setup called [UnitedBSD](https://unitedbsd.com/).
