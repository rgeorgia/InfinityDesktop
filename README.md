# Infinity Desktop
An attempt to roll a BSD desktop, specifically [NetBSD](http://netbsd.org/) and [DragonflyBSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/).

I have always been attracted to  both NetBSD  and DragonflyBSD. I am not saying that they the best BSD distros, they just seems to have a magnetic pull on me. Consequently, I want to make a good desktop experience with a solid operating system under the hood.

Actually this, like many other projects, is a scratch for my particular itch.

### First
I am **not** an expert, but I am willing to dig in, willing to learn and willing to listen to sound advice. I do not feel that everything needs to be invented here. I am more than willing to rip-off good ideas.

### Second
I am **not** a NetBSD or DragonflyBSD zealot. I am an **enthusiast**. I will not bash Windows or scoff at any distro of Linux. You will not find any snarky comments about systemd or anyother technology I am completely ignorant about. 
I will, however, try to learn from them, borrowing the good ideas and avoiding painful ones.

I will also not try to make Infinity DE a Windows-like, Mac-like or Linux-like; it will be Ron-like. Honestly, this may not be for everyone.

### Desktop
I am focusing on [FVWM](https://www.fvwm.org/). The final result should be a lightweight and very flexible desktop environment. 

Roadmap and other misc things are on our [wiki](https://github.com/rgeorgia/OS108/wiki)

Totally inspired by the good folks that brought you [GhostBSD](https://github.com/ghostbsd)! GhostBSD is built on [TrueOS](https://www.trueos.org/), which is another excellent project. I totally recommend you check them out. Some of us even support them financially. Yup I love GhostBSD!

The other major "kick in the pants" which I needed came from the author of [OS108](https://github.com/OS108/os108.github.io).
Jay is a great guy and I would also recommend that you visit his github repo and an excellent
forum he setup called [UnitedBSD](https://unitedbsd.com/).
