# Infinity Desktop
An attempt to roll a BSD desktop, specifically for [NetBSD](http://netbsd.org/).

I have always been attracted to **NetBSD**. I am not saying that it is the best BSD distros, **NetBSD** just seems to have a magnetic pull on me. Consequently, I want to make a good desktop experience with a solid operating system under the hood.

Actually this, like many other projects, is a scratch for my particular itch.

### First
I am **not** an expert, but I am willing to dig in, willing to learn and willing to listen to sound advice. I do not feel that everything needs to be invented here. I am more than willing to rip-off good ideas.

### Second
I am __not__ a **NetBSD** zealot. I am an **enthusiast**. I will not bash Windows or scoff at any distro of Linux. You will not find any snarky comments about systemd or any other technology that I know nothing about.

I will also not try to make Infinity DE a _Windows-like_, _Mac-like_ or _Linux-like_; it will be _Ron-like_. Honestly, this may not be for everyone.

### Desktop
I am focusing more on [fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/) for now. I did some work with [FVWM](https://www.fvwm.org/). Either way, the final result should be a lightweight and very flexible desktop environment. 

For a "heavier" desktop I may also look at [xfce4](https://www.xfce.org/) and [enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/). 

Roadmap and other misc things are on our [wiki](https://github.com/rgeorgia/OS108/wiki)

Totally inspired by the good folks that brought you [GhostBSD](https://github.com/ghostbsd)! GhostBSD is built on [TrueOS](https://www.trueos.org/), which is another excellent project. I totally recommend you check them out. Some of us even support them financially. Yup I **love** GhostBSD!

The other major "kick in the pants" which I needed came from the author of [OS108](https://github.com/OS108/os108.github.io).
Jay is a great guy and I would also recommend that you visit his github repo and an excellent forum he setup called [UnitedBSD](https://unitedbsd.com/).
